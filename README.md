# Survival-Rate
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.  This mini-project involves the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

I have created an interactive shiny-app to retreive the survival rate of passengers based upon the user's choice of factors. Kindly have a look at the following link to check out my shiny-app: https://mughundhanc.shinyapps.io/Titanic/
